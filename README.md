# Sorting Algorithms Analysis

A battle of sorting algorithms. Given data from the input file, program makes it either randomized, partially sorted, in-order, or reverse sorted array. The entire program tests different sorting algorithms to test the performance of each, based on different data.

This was made for Data Structures class at the University of Bucharest, taught by Professor Dumitran Marius.
